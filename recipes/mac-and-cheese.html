                <strong>Instructions</strong><br>
                Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in dry macaroni noodles. Pour in enough water to barely cover macaroni. 
                Bring to a boil, stirring continuously.<br><br>

                Continue stirring the macaroni until water is almost evaporated and pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. <br>
                Pour in evaporated milk and cream. Add grated cheese and stir until cheese has melted and everything is well combined. <br>
                <br>
                Serve immediately.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cook's Notes:</strong><br>
                Any type of good quality cheese may be used. I suggest trying extra sharp Colby, but you can also try a blend of cheese.<br>
                <br>
                Because the cheese I use had been brined I didn't need to use salt or any add ins a traditional macaroni and cheese calls for.<br>
                <br>
                This recipe must be tended to continuously. You can't walk away otherwise you risk the pasta sticking to your skillet.
